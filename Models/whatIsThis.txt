This folder contains all pytorch model definition files. Usually these models don't have training loops built in.

Models
______________________________________________

ConstrainedSeq2Seq: Model that has an RNN encoder and decoder, as well as a feedforward internal latent transformation. 
The encoder and decoder are trained together as an autoencoder, then they are frozen and the model is trained end to end to train the latent transformation.
